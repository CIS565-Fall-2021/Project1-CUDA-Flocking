## About The Project

A flocking simulation based on the <strong>Reynolds Boids algorithm</strong>, along with two levels of optimization: a <strong>uniform grid</strong>, and a <strong>uniform grid with semi-coherent memory access</strong>.

Stats: 
- CPU: i7-10700F @ 2.90GHz
- GPU: SM 8.6 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080
- Number of Boids: 12 million 
- Average FPS: ~40

## Performance Analysis

In this project, we investigate 3 approaches to implement the Reynolds Boids algorithm:

1. Naive approach has each boid check every other boid in the simulation. 
2. 
3.  we optimize using a uniform grid with semi-coherent memory access. To validate the effects of this optimzation
