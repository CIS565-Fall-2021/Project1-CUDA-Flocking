### (TODO: Your README)

Include screenshots, analysis, etc. (Remember, this is public, so don't put
anything here that you don't want to share with the world.)


For each implementation, how does changing the number of boids affect performance? Why do you think this is?

For each implementation, how does changing the block count and block size affect performance? Why do you think this is?


For the coherent uniform grid: did you experience any performance improvements with the more coherent uniform grid? Was this the outcome you expected? Why or why not?


Did changing cell width and checking 27 vs 8 neighboring cells affect performance? Why or why not? Be careful: it is insufficient (and possibly incorrect) to say that 27-cell is slower simply because there are more cells to check!
